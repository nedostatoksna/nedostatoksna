### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Margarita Zhentsova, and I'm a frontend developer. My primary specialization is creating user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as developing applications based on React, Next.js, using TypeScript.

## Skills

- **HTML/CSS:** I have an advanced level of proficiency in HTML5 and CSS3. I can create semantic and responsive layouts and style elements using CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap).

- **JavaScript:** I have a good understanding of the JavaScript language and its core concepts. I can write clean and modular code, use the latest features of ES6+, and work with asynchronous code.

- **React:** I have experience in developing Single Page Applications (SPAs) using the React library. I can create high-level components, manage application state, and work with React Router for navigation.

- **Next.js:** I'm familiar with the Next.js framework and have experience applying it in projects. I can use it to create Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) applications, optimize their performance, and improve SEO.
  
- **TypeScript:** I know TypeScript and apply it for static type checking of code, which helps prevent errors and improves code understanding by other developers.
