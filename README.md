### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Margarita Zhentsova, and I'm a frontend developer with over a year of experience in web development. My main specialization is creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as React and Next.js frameworks.

## Skills

- **HTML/CSS:** I have an advanced level of proficiency in HTML5 and CSS3. I can create semantic and responsive layouts and style elements using CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap).

- **JavaScript:** I have a good understanding of the JavaScript language and its core concepts. I can write clean and modular code, use the latest features of ES6+, and work with asynchronous code.

- **React:** I have experience in developing Single Page Applications (SPAs) using the React library. I can create high-level components, manage application state, and work with React Router for navigation.

- **Next.js:** I'm familiar with the Next.js framework and have experience applying it in projects. I can use it to create Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) applications, optimize their performance, and improve SEO.

## Projects
